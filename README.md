Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

During my internship at hashtag #SkillCraftTechnology, I successfully completed Task 2. The Titanic dataset is one of the most iconic datasets in data science. Recently, I embarked on a comprehensive journey of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering using this dataset, and the insights were nothing short of fascinating!

Key Highlights:
1️⃣ Handling Missing Values:

Imputed missing values in Age using the median.
Addressed null entries in Embarked by filling with the mode.
Simplified the dataset by dropping the sparsely populated Cabin column.
2️⃣ Converting Data Types:

Optimized memory by converting categorical variables like Survived and Pclass into categories.
3️⃣ Visual Insights:

Explored age and fare distributions, unveiling trends in passenger demographics.
Analyzed survival rates by factors like gender, age, and embarkation points using visual tools like count plots and box plots.
4️⃣ Feature Engineering:

Created new features like FamilySize and IsAlone to evaluate their impact on survival.
Evaluated feature importance using a Random Forest model.
5️⃣ Results:

Top predictors of survival included Fare, Sex, and Age.
Visualization techniques highlighted the powerful story behind the numbers, bringing the tragedy and survival dynamics to life.


This project was a great learning experience that improved my skills in data analysis, visualization, and working with real-world datasets. I am excited to apply these enhanced skills to future projects and challenges at hashtag#SkillCraftTechnology.
